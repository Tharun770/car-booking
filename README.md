CAR BOOKING SYSTEM

🚗 Excited to Share My Latest Mini Project: A Car Booking System using Python & Tkinter! 🚀

I recently built a **Car Booking System** using **Python (Tkinter)** for the GUI and **SQLite** for data storage. This project simplifies car booking by providing a user-friendly interface where users can select a car, enter their details, and store the booking in a database.

### 🔹 Project Overview :
1️⃣ **User-Friendly GUI** – Built using Tkinter, making it simple and interactive. <BR>
2️⃣ **Database Storage** – Uses SQLite to store all booking records efficiently.<BR>
3️⃣ **Tabular Data View** – Displays all bookings in a structured table format.<BR>
4️⃣ **Lightweight & Fast** – Runs smoothly as a desktop application without heavy dependencies.<BR>
5️⃣ **Future Enhancements** – Plans to add search, edit/delete features, and Flask web integration.<BR>

💡 This project helped me strengthen my skills in **Python, GUI development, and database management**. I'm planning to enhance it further by adding **search functionality, edit/delete features, and even a Flask web integration**! 🚀

Would love to hear your thoughts! What features would you like to see in such an application? Drop your suggestions in the comments! 😊👇
